This payload extracts information from the target machine... IP addresses, users, running services, even Wi-Fi passwords. All of this information goes to a text file created on the machine's desktop. Once the payload is complete, the text file remains on the desktop. The idea is to quickly change FlipperZero's mode to mass storage mode and use the Flipper as if it were a normal USB flash drive. Paste the text file with all the information into the flipper ¨Disk¨ D: or E: or else.
